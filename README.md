# Weightlifting-Progress-Tracker
A program that can automatically scrape information on my workouts from my iPhone Notes app

Extracts the repetitions and weight recorded for each time I performed any of five main lifts: squat, benchpress, deadlift, overhead press, and skullcrusher.
Using this information, the program uses a formula to determine my One Rep Max (ORM) for the given lift, which acts as a stand-in for my strength at that lift. 
The program then plots these ORMs over time and compares them to my weight log, to see if the bulk/cut I did this year had much of an impact on my lifts.
